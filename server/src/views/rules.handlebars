<h2>Game Rules</h2>

<div class="card">
  <h3>Overview</h3>
  <p>
    Woodland War is an asymmetric strategy game for 2-4 players. Each player controls a unique faction 
    vying for control of the great woodland. The first player to score 30 victory points—or to 
    fulfill their dominance card condition—wins the game!
  </p>

  <h3>The Woodland</h3>
  <p>
    The game board represents a woodland divided into 12 clearings connected by paths. Each clearing 
    belongs to one of three suits: Fox, Rabbit, or Mouse. Clearings have building slots that limit 
    how many structures can be built there.
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Paths:</strong> Connect clearings and allow movement between them</li>
    <li><strong>Rivers:</strong> Some paths follow rivers, which may affect certain actions</li>
    <li><strong>Forests:</strong> The spaces between clearings are forests, where the Wanderer can hide</li>
  </ul>
</div>

<div class="card">
  <h3>Turn Structure</h3>
  <p>Each turn consists of three phases:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Birdsong:</strong> Start-of-turn effects based on your faction</li>
    <li><strong>Daylight:</strong> Take actions to advance your position</li>
    <li><strong>Evening:</strong> Draw cards and score points</li>
  </ul>
</div>

<div class="card">
  <h3>Basic Actions</h3>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Move:</strong> Move warriors from one clearing to an adjacent clearing. You must rule the origin or destination.</li>
    <li><strong>Battle:</strong> Attack another faction in a clearing where you have warriors. Roll dice to determine hits.</li>
    <li><strong>Build:</strong> Place a building in a clearing you rule with an open building slot.</li>
    <li><strong>Recruit:</strong> Add new warriors to clearings based on your faction's rules.</li>
    <li><strong>Craft:</strong> Use cards matching clearings you rule to craft items for victory points.</li>
  </ul>
</div>

<div class="card">
  <h3>Rule &amp; Combat</h3>
  <p>
    A faction <strong>rules</strong> a clearing if they have the most combined warriors and buildings there. 
    Ties mean no one rules.
  </p>
  <p>
    In <strong>combat</strong>, each player rolls a die (0-3). The attacker deals hits equal to the higher 
    roll (max: defender's pieces), and the defender deals hits equal to the lower roll (max: attacker's warriors). 
    Warriors are removed first, then buildings. Removing buildings scores victory points!

  <h3>Victory Conditions</h3>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Victory Points:</strong> First to 30 VP wins immediately</li>
    <li><strong>Dominance:</strong> Play a dominance card to change your win condition to controlling specific clearings</li>
    <li><strong>Coalition:</strong> The Wanderer may form a coalition with another player to share victory</li>
  </ul>
</div>

<div class="card">
  <h3>Cards &amp; Crafting</h3>
  <p>
    The shared deck contains Ambush cards (for combat), Item cards (for crafting), and special Favor cards 
    (powerful effects). To craft an item, you must rule clearings matching the card's crafting cost. 
    Crafted items score victory points or give you powerful abilities.
